MVA projects
============

This folder contains most of the homework and final project that I completed as part of the Math√©matiques Vision Apprentissage (Mathematics Vision Learning) master.

I took 6 classes during the year 2016-2017 that mostly focused on computer vision.

Several homeworks started with code provided by the teachers (all the practical sessions for the 3D vision class for instance had most coding parts provided).

Homeworks were written in python, C++ and matlab, and some relied on the caffe framework.
