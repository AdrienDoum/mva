The final project for the [object recognition](http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/object-recognition-and-computer-vision-221990.kjsp?RH=1242430202531) class.

We tried (mostly unsuccessfully) to predict whether frames from a video are in the chronological or reversed order.

We made several attempts, using various neural network architectures of which 2 are presented in this folder :

- a 3d convolutional network

- a classifier (shallow neural network) on top of features extracted with a pretrained neural network
